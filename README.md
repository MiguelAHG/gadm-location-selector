# Student Mapping Project

This is the repository for the GADM Location Selector app, which is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. This app allows the user to select any administrative area (province, city or municipality, barangay) in the Philippines and obtain its GID value. This refers to a unique identifier provided by the GADM database.

This app was created as a supplementary tool for another project. It is meant to be used in the context of a survey where respondents must input a location. Using GID values allows the location data to be stored in a standardized format.
